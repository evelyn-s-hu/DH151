                    Hello! My name is Evelyn and I am a fourth year Cognitive Science major. I'm from Mountain View, CA,
                    but I grew up in Seattle, Washington. This quarter, I am working as a research assistant in the Human Perception Lab
                    at UCLA and as a content creator intern at start-up company. In my free time, I enjoy cooking and baking, playing 
                    video games, and drawing. 
                <br><br>
                    When I added this course, I wasn't actually aware what the course would be about; to be honest, I'm a few upper division 
                    credits short of completing my degree, so I just decided to enroll in this course as I had taken a couple other DH classes 
                    before. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that we would be utilizing <b>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</b> alongside 
                    <u>digital mapping technologies</u>. I've been interested in web programming languages since I was in <i>elementary school</i>; I attempted 
                    to teach myself how to code, but I've never received proper training on it. I'm excited to brush up on these skills, as I feel 
                    they are important to have in today's job market. 
                <br><br>
